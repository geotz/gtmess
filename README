Switchboard (chat) text input:
------------------------------
* to talk, just type any text and press enter to send it to the switchboard server
* while you are typing, typing notifications are being sent in 4sec intervals.
* if the string begins with "/", then it forms a special command 
  (and typing notifications are not being sent while you are typing it).
* use // if you want to send one "/" in the beginning

switchboard commands:
---------------------
/ <text>
	(there is space after slash!)  
	This command sends <text> to the chat session without typing notification!
        (this happens because the text gets typed while in command-entry mode ("/"))

	send RAW command string to SB server
