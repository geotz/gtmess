.SH NAME
gtmess - MSN messenger client

.SH SYNOPSIS
gtmess [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
gtmess is an MSN messenger client, which allows you to use
the MSN messenger service. It is a console application that
uses the curses library to present a friendly user interface.
This manpage corresponds to version 0.9.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR -h ", " --help
Short help.

.TP
.BI -O variable = value
Assigns the
.I value
to the configuration
.BR variable .

.TP
.BI --version
Print the program version and CVR string to stdout and exit.

.SH CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
The following list shows all configuration variables in alphabetic order.
The value of a variable is either an integer or a (line-terminated) 
string of characters.
In the following descriptions,
.I N
represents an integer value,
.I S
represents a character string value and
.I B
represents a boolean value, a special case of an integer value 
with only two possible values, 0 and 1. 1 stands for True and 0 for False.

.TP
.BI aliases "" = N
When
.I N
is 2, the user-defined contact aliases are displayed instead of nick names.
A value of 1 displays aliases only when nicknames are too long (see
.B max_nick_len
variable) or when nicknames contain the email address (which is very irritating).
A value of 0 disables the use of aliases completely and nick names are always
displayed. User-defined contact aliases are stored into 
.B ~/.gtmess/aliases 
(see the
.B FILES
section). The default value is
.BR 1.

.TP
.BI auto_login "" = B
When enabled, the login procedure starts as soon as the client is invoked,
provided that
.B login
and
.B password
variables are nonempty.
The default value is
.BR 1.

.TP
.BI cert_prompt "" = B
If enabled and a certificate cannot be verified against
the list of trusted certificate authorities (see the
.B FILES
section),
the user is asked if the login process should continue. 
Three options are given,
.IR Yes ,
.I No 
and
.IR Always .
The meaning of each option is obvious.
The login procedure requires more than one SSL connection, so option
.I Always
means that successive SSL connections will also continue upon unverified certificates.
If this option is disabled, then the procedure always continues without asking the user, 
even if certificates cannot be verified.
The default value is
.BR 1 .

.TP
.BI colors "" = N
Sets initial color mode.
Possible values are 0, 1 or 2. With 0, color is selected automatically
(according to curses). 1 forces color mode, while 2 forces black and white.
The default value is
.B 0
(automatic).

.TP
.BI common_name_prompt "" = B
Like
.BR cert_prompt ,
the user is asked if the login process should continue,
when the common name does not match the host name upon
the initialization of an SSL connection.
The default value is
.BR 1.

.TP
.BI console_encoding "" = S
Sets the character encoding to be used for displaying the text on the console.
.I S
is the name of the encoding. To see all valid encoding names, look at
the output of the
.BR "iconv -l" " command"
(on systems that provide it). If
.I S
is
.B *locale*
then the console encoding is that of the 
.IR LC_CTYPE 
property of the current locale.
The default value is
.BR *locale* .

.TP
.BI cvr "" = S
Sets the consumer versioning (CVR) string that is sent to the server during
the login process. This string provides information about the client. For more
information you should look at the protocol specification. The protocol requires
(from version MSNP8 and above) your login account to be the last part
of the CVR string. Since gtmess uses MSNP9, your login account 
is appended automatically at the end.
The default value is computed at configure-time and is of the following form:
.br
0x0409 <system> <os-version> <architecture> GTMESS <clientversion> MSMSGS
.br
For example:
.BR "0x0409 Linux 2.6.8-1-686 i686 GTMESS 0.9 MSMSGS" .

.TP 
.BI gtmesscontrol_ignore "" = S
Ignore gtmess-specific messages that are substrings of
.IR S "."
To accept all such messages, leave
.I S
empty. To ignore all such messages, use the special value
.BR *all* ,
which is also the default value.

.TP 
.BI idle_sec "" = N
If greater than zero, specifies how many seconds should pass
without the user pressing any key before his/her status is automatically
set to Idle. If
.I N
is zero, this feature is disabled. Note that the status is automatically
set to Idle only if the previous status is Online.
The default value is
.BR 180 .

.TP 
.BI initial_status "" = N
Sets the initial status after login. For the MSN Messenger protocol
.I N
can be a number from 0 to 8 representing the following statuses:
0 = 
.BR Offline , 
1 = 
.BR "Appear Offline" , 
2 = 
.BR Online ,
3 =
.BR Idle ,
4 =
.BR Away ,
5 =
.BR Busy ,
6 =
.BR "Be Right Back" ,
7 =
.BR "On the Phone" ,
8 = 
.BR "Out to Lunch" .
.br
The default value is
.B 2
(Online).

.TP
.BI invitable "" = B
If disabled, others cannot invite you to conversation windows because
the client does not respond to the invitations they send. So, if you
want to chat, you have to invite others to the conversation windows yourself.
If enabled, then gtmess automatically accepts invitations to switchboard
sessions. Note that this option overrides the BLP setting which is stored
at the server and is about users not on your forward list.
This option is enabled by default.

.TP
.BI login "" = S
Sets the default login account. If
.I S
does not contain an `@' character, then the string `@hotmail.com' is appended.

.TP
.BI log_traffic "" = B
If enabled, network traffic between the client and the notification
server is recorded into file 
.BR ~/.gtmess/msn.log .
The default value is
.BR 0 .

.TP
.BI max_nick_len "" = N
Specifies the maximum allowed nickname length before displaying the alias.
If
.I N
is 0, then aliases are displayed only if the nickname does not fit on a single
line of the contact list window.
The default value is
.BR 0.

.TP
.BI msg_debug "" = N
Defines the client behaviour on unrecognised messages. If
.I N
is 0, then those messages are ignored silently.
If
.I N
is 1, then the type of the message is displayed, and if
.I N
is 2, the whole message is displayed. This option
is useful for development purposes.
The default value is
.BR 0.

.TP
.BI msg_notify "" = N
If
.I N
is greater than 0, gtmess notifies you when a new message is received even
when the corresponding chat window is in the foreground. This
feature is useful in graphical environments where the gtmess (console) window 
may not be visible all the time. However, you will not be notified
if less than
.I N
seconds have passed since the previous message. This is to avoid
too many notifications thay might be annoying. In fact, if
.I N
is 1, then the extra notification will occur only when the user is
in Idle mode.
The default value is
.B 1.

.TP
.BI msnftpd "" = N
Specifies the port number the MSNFTP server is listening to.
The MSNFTP server is a thread that runs in the background and enables
outgoing file transfers by allowing incoming connections. A value
of 0 disables the server.
The default value is
.BR 6891 .

.TP
.BI online_only "" = B
If enabled, only contacts with online status are shown on the screen.
The default value is
.BR 0.

.TP 
.BI password "" = S
Sets the default password.

.TP
.BI popup "" = B
Enables/disables the popup notification window at the lower right corner of
the screen. This is an external Tcl/Tk script.
The default value is
.BR 1.

.TP
.BI server "" = S
Sets the initial server to connect to. For the MSN Messenger protocol,
this can be a dispatch or a notification server.
.I S
is of the form
.IR hostname [ :port ].
If port is not specified, 1863 is assumed.
The default value is 
.BR messenger.hotmail.com .

.TP
.BI sound "" = N
Sets sound mode.
.I N
can be 0, 1 or 2. 0 disables all sound, 1 produces always a (console) beep,
while 2 plays sound effects (through a sound device).
The default value is
.B 1
(beep).

.TP
.BI syn_cache "" = B
If enabled, the contact/group lists are cached for future use. This option
seems to have no meaning nowadays, as the msn server always rejects the cached version
of the list. It has been disabled in this version of the client and will be removed
completely in the future.
The default value is
.BR 0.

.TP
.BI time_user_types "" = N
Sets how often typing notifications are sent. It is the time interval in seconds.
The default value is
.BR 5.

.SH USER INTERFACE
.PP
The screen is divided in 7 parts. Four lines and three windows.
The first line of the screen displays your nickname, your account and
your status. The right-hand corner shows the system's clock (local time).
The bottom line displays the copyright string and the menus 
or the input boxes.
On the right is the contact list window. On the left of the contact list
window is the switchboard (chat) window. Right below the switchboard window
is the messages window. This window displays various messages and errors
from the operating system, as well as the notification server. The switchboard
window is separated from the messages window by two lines. The first line
is the edibox where you type your text when you chat. The second line
is a kind of window-bar that displays a character for each open switchboard
window. The selected switchboard window (which is displayed) is represented
with an `O'. A `-' represents a switchboard window that is open but not
on the foreground, while a `+' means additionally that the designated
window has unread messages (something got typed in the window while
it was in the background and the user has not seen it yet).

.PP
In the following description of the keyboard controls, `^' denotes holding CTRL, while
`$' denotes holding SHIFT. `@' denotes holding ALT (or mod1 or pressing ESC
first).

Type `//' if you want to send a message with one `/' in the beginning.

.SS SWITCHBOARD COMMANDS

.TP
.BI "/ " string
This command sends
.I string
to the server without a typing notification. This actually happens
because the string gets typed in command-entry mode (`/'). Note that there is
a space after the first slash.

.TP
.BI "/send " string
Send a raw command string to server.

.TP
.BI "/invite " useraccount
Invite the user with account
.I useraccount
to join the switchboard session. You can also use the shorcut
.B /i
for this command. Example:
.br
.B /i myfriend@hotmail.com

.SS TYPING NOTIFICATIONS
.PP
When a user is typing a message, a typing notification is usually sent by the user's client.
Not all clients are able to send or receive typing notifications. However, gtmess both sends
and receives typing notifications. It is also able to do some kind of spoofing 
(see next section). When a typing notification is received, an exclamation mark (`!')
is displayed on the left of the user's name on the contact list. This means that the
user is typing a message in some switchboard window. Although it is possible to
know the specific s/b window, the current version does not distinguish between s/b windows.
Hopefully this will be fixed in the future.


.SH ADVANCED FEATURES
.PP
There are some features of the protocol that gtmess takes advantage of, while
the original client for windows does not use them. These features are:

.TP
.B *
Get notified when somebody has opened a chat window to you
(but has not sent a message yet).

.TP
.B *
Allow you to log in with a different initial status.

.B NOTE:
In the past, you if logged in as 
.B "Appear Offline"
other users would still receive some offline events and if you originally were offline,
they could suspect that you had just logged in. Nowadays this server bug has been fixed.

.TP
.B *
Allow you to send a fake typing notification. This does not affect all clients.
However, you can have fun with the original client!

.TP
.B *
Allow you to know if somebody is online, but has blocked you.
To find out if a user is blocking you do the following: Open a switchboard window and
invite the user you think has blocked you (whom you see offline) to the session. 
If you receive an error 216, then the user has blocked you. 
Otherwise, if you receive an error 217 then we cannot tell.
When you receive error 217 there are two cases:
1) The user is really offline and you can't find out if he or she has blocked you. 
2) The user appears offline and hasn't blocked you. 
.br
To sum up, if a user is logged in
and has blocked you, you will receive error 216.

.B NOTE:
This feature was actually available due to a bug at the original messenger server.
Nowadays the bug has been fixed, so block detection does not work any more. It is
mentioned here for historic purposes.


.SH FILES
.TP
.B ~/.gtmess/
Main configuration directory. This directory relies in the user's home directory
and stores the following gtmess-specific files:

.TP
.B ~/.gtmess/aliases
The aliases file. It contains lines of the form
.IR email " " alias .
Lines beginning with `#' are considered to be comments, and therefore ignored.
The alias export feature provides a convenient way to create an initial version
of this file and then edit it by hand.

.TP
.B ~/.gtmess/config
The configuration file. It contains lines of the form
.IR variable = value .
Lines beginning  with `#' are considered to be comments, and therefore ignored.

.TP
.B ~/.gtmess/received/
Received files from other users are stored
in this directory.

.TP
.B ~/.gtmess/msn.log
The traffic log (see the
.I log_traffic 
variable).

.TP
.B ~/.gtmess/notify.pip
This file is a named pipe that is used by the gtmess-notify script to pop up notification
windows. The client writes data in this file.

.TP
.B ./root.pem
Trusted root certificates, verified upon the initialization 
of an SSL connection. Gtmess first looks into the current directory
for this file, then into 
.B ~/.gtmess/ 
and then into the default data prefix, usually
.BR /usr/local/share/gtmess .

.SH BUGS

This is a list of known bugs and limitations. 
They will be removed as soon as possible.

Notification or Passport login servers are not cached.

If you send a file, you cannot see the IP of the receiver. 
When you receive a file, you cannot be server. 
When you send a file, you cannot be client.

There is no option to keep an idle connection alive.

There may occur conflicts in the authorization cookies of file transfers (though rare).

Messages are always assumed to be UTF-8 encoded.

No automatic offline user rename.
