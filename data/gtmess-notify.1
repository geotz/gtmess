.SH NAME
gtmess-notify - popup notification windows

.SH SYNOPSIS
gtmess-notify

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
gtmess-notify is a simple Tcl/Tk script that pops up notification
windows starting from the lower right corner of the screen. 
The script watches a named pipe for new lines and displays the contents of
each line in a separate popup window.
It was written as a companion to the
.B gtmess
messenger client, but could be of general use.

.SH EXAMPLE

First we start our daemon:

$ gtmess-notify &

Then we can popup anything, like:

$ echo "hello world" > ~/.gtmess/notify.pip

However, the script terminates when the last client closes
the pipe. So we 'd better keep it open.
Or we can just run gtmess :-)

$ gtmess-notify &
.br
some_other_terminal> gtmess
.br
$ echo "now" > ~/.gtmess/notify.pip
.br
$ echo "it works!" > ~/.gtmess/notify.pip

.SH FILES
.TP
.B ~/.gtmess/notify.pip
The named pipe where the text to be displayed is read from.

.BR gtmess\_w "(1)"

.SH CREDITS

Inspired from the aMSN messenger client.
