*** gtmess version 0.8.2 (15 Nov 2003) ***

Since 14 November, 2003, the 0.8.1 client fails to log in
with any account. The reason is the CVR string.
The server decided to reject CVR strings that
do not contain the account name as their last part. Version 0.8.1
sents a simple `null' instead of the account name as the last part
of the CVR string. So, I was forced to release version 0.8.2
which fixes this problem and incorporates some minor changes
that have been made up to now. 
Look at the ChangeLog for more information.
