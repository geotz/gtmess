*** gtmess version 0.94 (26 Dec 2007) ***

Time for a new version, isn't it? Take it as a christmas gift! :-)
Actually, I had it ready from the summer, but I didn't find the time 
to update the manpage. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the new menu bar system 
and the selectable contacts on the right ;-)
As usual, ChangeLog contains a detailed list of the new features.

Have fun...
